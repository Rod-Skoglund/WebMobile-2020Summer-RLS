## **Web-Lesson1**

This repository is used for the 2020 Summer session of the Web and Mobile Programming course (CSEE-5590). The 2020Summer-Web\Web_Lesson1 subfolder is the first ICP in the Web Programming section. It covers installation/upgrade of WebStorm and getting setup (if not already established) in GitHub. This assignment will also cover several GitHub activities to develop a safe way to contribute as a team working on a single project in GirtHub. 

Here is the GitHub WebMobile-2020Summer Repository.
